# Logic Student Manager

This is a small project for me to manage my students' scores in the university. This semester I am teaching 5 different courses, so I have more than 120 students. I didn't want to keep track of the scores in Excel, so I wrote a program which can process different formatted inputs, which either I or the CooSpace use.

The app stores the students' data in the browser's local storage, so sensitive data cannot be acquired through this repository.

I made the moving and direct editing of the data very easy, through a simple text area which lets you edit the JSON data.
