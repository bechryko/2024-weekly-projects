# Weed Guesser

This is a prototype of a strategic game heavily inspired by Phasmophobia. You have to guess the weed that is invading your garden underground, based on the different evidences and special characteristics of each weed. You can also plant different types of plants to help you identify the weed.

I am - finally - happy with how much I could achieve this week, and I definitely want to continue this game later.

## Weeds

You can read about the different weeds in-game, in the weeds menu. Here are the evidences each weed can give you:
- **Full-growth**: the weed can spread to even the whole garden, it is not limited to only the half of it.
- **Water absorption**: all weeds absorb some water from the ground, but these type of weeds will do it significantly faster. Planting different plants are a good idenfitier to see if the ground runs out of water faster than usual.
- **Disenchantment**: there is a magical material flowing in the ground, called miosn. There are 1-3 miosn sources in the edges of your garden, where the magic can flow from. But if the weed has disenchantment evidence, the miosn cannot flow through tiles with this weed on it. It can flow to it, but it cannot flow further.

## Plants

### Dawner

This is a very basic plant, not requiring any miosn, and absorbing a small amount of water. Great tool to find where the weed is, and even with some practice you can identify if the weed has water absorption evidence.

### Sparrow Root

This plant requires a small amount of miosn to grow, and absorbs a small amount of water. It does not only show if the miosn present is enough for it to stay alive, but shows a small interval where the exact miosn level is. Excellent for identifying the Miosn Eater weed, due to its special ability.

### Poseidon Flower

This plant requires a large amount of miosn to grow, and absorbs a large amount of water. It uses the miosn to spread water to nearby tiles, potentially saving other plants from drying out when a weed is present.

## Plans for the future

- minerals in the ground, which can be polluted by the weeds (also a weed that causes special mutations in plants by the polluted minerals)
- infection evidence: the weed can infect the plants, not only mutate them by polluted minerals
- more plants, more weeds
- customization options

## In memory of Szperó

This friday our beloved cat, Szperó passed, who was with our family - a part of our family - for more than 12 years. I named the Sparrow Root after her, as a little memory. I hope she finds another place where she can be happy, now, that she can't walk up and down in our garden, among our flowers and plants anymore. Rest in peace, our dear cat.
