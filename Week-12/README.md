# Tableaux Method Generator: visualizer module

I continued my tableaux generator with this little module, which visualizes the tableaux tree on a simple canvas. I recreated the simplified version of the original tableaux tree structure, with dummy values, but I tried it with the real solver module, and it works perfectly. Next week I am ready to continue working on the last module of this generator.
