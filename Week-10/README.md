# Simple RPG Character Template

I don't have much time these weeks, so I tried a really simple project for now. I made a very basic HTML template with very basic CSS. The challenge was to make an RPG Character Template's layout as fast as possible, and I think it was very successful. The template is also usable for writing down RPG characters or even more information (quests, items in shops), which does not have a UI, but easily editable in the single HTML file.
