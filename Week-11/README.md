# Tableaux Method Generator: solver module

I want to make a little Tableaux Method task generator for the logics course I'm teaching in the university. I decided to split it up to different modules, and the first one is the solver itself. It gets a formule as a string as input, and returns whether the formule is satisfiable or not. And if it is satisfiable, it also return a satisfying assignment.
