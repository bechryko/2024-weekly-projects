# Befriend the Button!

This is a very minimalistic game, where I wanted to go back to my plain JavaScript days. I made tons of canvas JS games, so now I tried one which doesnt involve a canvas, only a button.

This button is a very shy one, you have to be polite with him and not scare him too much. With enough work and effort, you can befriend him and click on him, which is the goal of this game. Enjoy playing and learning the button's behavior patterns!

## Setup

Since CSS is essential to this game, you have to translate the SCSS style file to CSS. Once this is done, you can starting playing the game by opening the `index.html` file in your browser.
