# Canvas Game Tools library

I always wanted to make some kind of library. And I have made a lot of canvas games in pure JavaScript in the past 6 years, so I thought, why not make a library for canvas games? This library includes some very basic functionalities to create a game with animations and movable characters. I really wanted to add more features, but the time was limited. But I learnt some things about making a library, and thought of some very essential rules when making one, which showed me that it is not as easy as I thought it would be. I definitely want to continue this project in the future, to make this an easily usable tool for making JavaScript canvas games.

## Previous project idea: Machine Learning module

My previous idea was to make a machine learning driven module to one of my existing projects. Unfortunately I ran into a lot of technical issues, so I cancelled this, but maybe I try it again in the future. This idea took a lot of days from this week, so the final project was a bit rushed.
