# GymLadybug (base)

This is merely the start of the Gym Ladybug project, which I wanted to start for a month now, and this weekly project marathon felt the perfect opportunity for it. Unfortunately I had only 4 days to work on it because of upcoming exams, but it was an interesting experience to make so much progression in a relatively complex app in such a short time. Also, it was the first time I made a mostly database-based Angular application from scratch, so I'm happy with the result and I am looking forward to continue this project some time in the future.
