# Adventures with Little Mili: 2048

This game is the start of the 'Adventures with Little Mili' series, where you can play good old games with the assistance of Little Mili! But what kind of secrets and lore does this adorable face hold? Try this game to find out!
Unfortunately yet again I didn't have enough time to implement every idea I had, so this is basically a rewrite of my 3-years-old one-day project in Angular. I absolutely love the result, the dialogs with Little Mili, so I'm thrilled to continue the series, and I hope I can make the following games better and more full of Mili's personality.
